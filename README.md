Neural Network
==============

Learning exercise to program a neural network from scratch in c++.

Apart from C++, in this project I have been learning the following tools:
 - CMake.
 - Clang++ instead of g++.
 - Catch2 for unit testing.


#### Notes

Most of the time has been spent in getting the C++ environment (specially CMake) to
work properly, but to get the grasp of it the class [Layer](src/main/Layer.cpp)
and its children (and their [tests](src/test/layerTest.cpp)) is where I have put most of my effort.


## Build

```bash
cmake .
make
```

## Testing
We can rely on the Make test generated by CMake, or invoke the unit_tests executable directly.

```bash
make test

# or
./bin/unit_tests
```
